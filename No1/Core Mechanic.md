Roll a number of dice equal Challenge (plus any applicable modifiers). Count 1 Hit for each die equal to or greater than the Target (e.g., 4+).

If there is a 1 in the result set, you risk allowing the enemy to seize the initiative.

- If you have any unspent ranks in your focused Trait, you may choose to reroll any 1 in the result set.
- If the rerolled result set contains no 1s, total your Hits and your team maintains the Initiative.
- If the final result still contains any 1s, total your Hits and the enemy seizes the Initiative.
