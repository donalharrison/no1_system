# Core Loop

At the beginning of each Scene, the BAMF will set the Timer which represent how many rounds the Scene will encompass.

Some Scenes will consist of multiple encounters or sequences, each of which have their own Timer.

Once a Timer is set, the players and the BAMF make an Initiative test (*see Initiative*) to determine which team takes action first.

Play proceeds in rounds during which each player takes a turn.

On each turn, the player can take one Shift and one Action.

Shifts represent quick actions or movement that take minimal concentration or effort.

Actions are more concerted efforts and advanced maneuvers that allow the player to effect the scene in dramatic ways.

If the result set of an Action contains a 1, the initiative shifts to the opposing team.

Play proceeds in this manner until the active Timer expires, and continues accordingly in the following scene.
