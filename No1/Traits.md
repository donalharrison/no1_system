# Traits

Traits describe the characters general qualities and characteristics, and categorize their Skills.

Traits are also used to re-roll 1s during a Waypoint.  Each player rolls 1d6 to determine which Trait is focused at the beginning of a Waypoint.  For the duration of that Waypoint, the player may re-roll any dice result of 1 equal to their focused Trait.

Traits also determine the character’s starting Skills at character creation.  Players choose a number of Skills equal to their Trait and gain +1 Skill Rating in those skills.

# Dangerous

Skills: Exert, Grapple, Intimidate, Martial Arts, Strike, Shoot, Throw

Magic: Inferno, Tempest, Mori

# Deft

Skills: Craft, Implements, Insight, Legerdemain, Operate, Pilot, Stealth, Tactics, Tumble

# Savvy

# Steady

# Uncanny

Traits combine to construct characters’ Defenses.  

All characters posses each of the 3 Defenses, but their Primary Defense is determined by their starting Profession.

The Primary Defense describes how the character generally avoids harm.

Defenses measure the number of Hits a character can take before suffering Vitality loss.  

Once a Defense is exhausted, all Hits are dealt directly to Vitality until the character recovers their Defenses.

Some Abilities target specific Defenses.  Any Hits from these Abilities ignore the character’s Primary Defense (unless, of course, the Ability targets the Primary Defense).

# Reflexes

# Nerve

Savvy + Steady + Uncanny

# Vigor

Dangerous + Steady + Uncanny

# Vitality

Vitality is equal to the total of the character’s Traits.
