# Initiative

Initiative is determined at the beginning of each conflict.  The opposing forces make an Initiative test, rolling a number of dice equal to the current Challenge.  Players choose to roll either Composure or Tactics, and total the number of Hits.  The Players’ total is compared to the total of the enemy force’s, and the team with the most Hits acts first.
