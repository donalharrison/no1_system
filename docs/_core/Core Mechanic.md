# System Principles
The No1s System is . . .

# Game Fiction Structural Overview
Gameplay in the No1s System is broken into segments of game fiction called *Waypoint*.  Analgous to a book chapter or play act, Waypoints range in duration from a few short Scenes to entire adventures and are bookended by an inciting incident and a resolution.  Each Waypoint consists of one or more Scenes which are broken down into one or more Encounters.  Encounters are comprised of one or more Sequences during which the Characters interact with the story.  Each level of the game's fiction structure (i.e., Waypoints, Scenes, Ecnounters, Sequences) serves to move the game fiction forward, often raising the stakes of the game and propelling the characters toward the dramatic conclusion.
Waypoints are defined collaboratively, with the BAMF taking the lead on coordinating and planning.  Players are encouraged elect certain goals, missions, and lead to pursue while planning a Waypoint, and the BAMF populates the plots, situations, and details contained within.
Defining Waypoints (along with Scenes, Encounters, & Sequences) are discussed in greater detail in the BAMF section.

# Core Mechanisms

## Challenge
Challenge is the complexity and danger of a Scene, escalating as the stakes of the game increase.  Mechanically, Challenge defines the number of dice the player rolls when attempting any action (i.e., Challenge 1 = roll 1d, Challenge 8 = roll 8d).  For each die equal to or greate than the Target, 

### Challenge: Result Sets, Hits, & 1s


## Entropy
Entropy is a measure of how frantic and chaotic the fiction is becoming.  Low Entropy represents a fictional arc where things are going the characters' way, while high Entropy reflects an arc where things are out of the characters' control.
Entropy increases each time a 1 is contained in a roll's final results set.

## Momentum
Momentum measures the level of success and proactivity the characters have attained.  High Momentum reflects arcs where the characters are experience consistent success in their pursuits.
Momentum increases each time a roll's final result set contains no 1s and the players maintain the initiative.

## Manuever -- Interacting with Challenge, Entropy, & Momentum
Players utilize the 

## Core Roll Mechanic

Roll a number of dice equal Challenge (plus any applicable modifiers). Count 1 Hit for each die equal to or greater than the Target (e.g., 4+).

If there is a 1 in the result set, you risk allowing the enemy to seize the Initiative.

- If you have any unspent ranks in your focused Trait, you may choose to reroll any 1 in the result set.
- If the rerolled result set contains no 1s, total your Hits and your team maintains the Initiative.
- If the final result still contains any 1s, total your Hits and the enemy seizes the Initiative.


# Core Gameplay Loop
Gameplay moves from Scene to Scene with characters taking action in each Encounter to affect a Scene's resolution.    At the beginning of each Encounter, the BAMF sets the Timer which represent hows many rounds the  will encompass.

Some Scenes will consist of multiple encounters or sequences, each of which have their own Timer.

Once a Timer is set, the players and the BAMF make an Initiative test (*see Initiative*) to determine which team takes action first.

Play proceeds in rounds during which each player takes a turn.

On each turn, the player can take one Shift and one Action.

Shifts represent quick actions or movement that take minimal concentration or effort.

Actions are more concerted efforts and advanced maneuvers that allow the player to effect the scene in dramatic ways.

If the result set of an Action contains a 1, the initiative shifts to the opposing team.

Play proceeds in this manner until the active Timer expires, and continues accordingly in the following scene.
