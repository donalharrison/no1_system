## Hexes
Debilitating & damaging effects that persist against hostile targets.
Hexes require Focus (or Compsure?) to maintain, with each Hex adding to the difficulty of the roll.

## Marvels

## Portents

## Rites
Divine gifts to help and harm.  Fail to conduct Rites correctly reduces the wielder's Concordance, breaking their connection to the divine and adding risk to their practice.
