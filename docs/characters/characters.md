Roll your background
Characters was not born yesterday into a life of protagonism.  What roads have the wandered?  What spoils have they pilfered?  Who do they want to kill or, maybe more interestingly, who wants to kill them?  The No1s system's background prcedure helps to prompt you to consider and answer questions like these and others to help fill in the detail of your character.
The background process also closely models the priamry gameplay procedure, allowing for even the newest players to familiarize themselves with the different types of dice, earning Hits, re-rolling 1s, etc.

Overview
You will take your character through some number of background terms, with only their Traits available to navigate the challenges they've faced.  Each term, you will select which Trait you are employing and determine a path associated with that Trait.  You then make a roll to determine how successful your character is during that term, with the Challenge equal to the term number and your Trait value determining your Dice Rating (e.g., Dangerous 1 = d6, Savvy 3 = d10).

Background Terms & Hits
When you make your roll each term, total your Hits.  You select a number of items from the background path equal to the Hits from the result set.  Once an item is selected from a path, it cannot be selected again during your background.


Background Terms & 1s
During each background term, you may re-roll 1s in the term's result set a a total number of times equal to your Trait score for terms when that Trait is being applied.  For example, if your character has Deft = 2 and rolls a 1 during a term as a Criminal, you can re-roll that 1 keeping the result of the re-roll.  Having spent 2 rank from your Deft, you would only have 1 more Deft re-roll available for the remainder of your background.

Background Terms & Entropy
If there are 1s in any term's final result set (i.e., after any re-rolls), increase the Entropy for your background by 1.  Entropy will be applied in the final Maneuver roll once you've decided to conclude your background.  Be careful -- the more Entropy generated during your background terms, the more complications you're likely to encounter at your backgrounds conclusion.
