Player & Charater Principles
- Your character is a device for moving the game & fiction forward, your Traits and Talents only serve to interact with the game fiction.
- The coolest thing to ever happen to your character ***has not happened yet!***  The only way to discover your character's greatest adventure is to *play and find out what happens*.
- Roleplaying is making decisions consistent with your ***character's*** goals, knowledge, & beliefs.  It does not require a fancy voice or mannerisms (though those can be fun), but it does require that you think about your character's motivations and the context of the game fiction.
