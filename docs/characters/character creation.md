# Character Creation

## Thesis
***Defining Your Character Concept***

As with all things creative or scientific, you have to have a starting point. The **Thesis** is the foundational statement of your character concept. It is a brief, 1-2 sentence summary that captures the core idea behind your character, including their tone, personality, and overarching theme. This statement serves as a guiding principle for developing your character’s background, motivations, and actions throughout the game.

#### How to Create a Thesis

When crafting your Thesis, consider the following:

1. **Core Idea:** What is the main concept or essence of your character? This could include their role, profession, or defining trait.
2. **Tone:** What is the overall mood or feel of your character? Are they heroic, tragic, mysterious, or comedic?
3. **Personality:** What are the key aspects of your character’s personality? This helps set the stage for how they will interact with others and approach challenges.
4. **Motivation:** What drives your character? Consider their goals, ambitions, or the events that have shaped their path.

#### Examples of Theses

- *"A stoic warrior seeking redemption for past mistakes, driven by a code of honor and duty."*
- *"A curious scholar eager to uncover ancient secrets, guided by a thirst for knowledge and adventure."*
- *"A cunning thief with a heart of gold, balancing a life of crime with a desire to protect the innocent."*
- *"A cheerful bard who brings joy to others, hiding their own past tragedies behind a mask of humor."*

#### Importance of the Thesis

The Thesis sets the tone for your character’s development and provides a clear direction for your roleplaying. It helps you stay true to your character’s core concept and ensures consistency in their actions and decisions. By starting with a strong Thesis, you create a solid foundation for a rich and engaging character that will enhance your overall gaming experience.

Use your Thesis as a touchstone throughout the game, allowing it to guide your character’s evolution and interactions. This initial statement will help you stay focused on your character’s essence and make your roleplaying more cohesive and immersive.

## T.H.E.M.E.

The character theme expands on the Thesis, providing details, fleshing out personality and motivation, and giving the players more cues to to inform their roelplaying.  The No 1's System breaks character themes into 5 components -- **Temperament**, **Heritage**, **Esteem**, **Motivation**, and **Experience**.  Each of these components are one piece of the larger picture and can be referenced when the player needs inspiration for how the character would interacts with the game fiction.

### Temperament
The character's personality at a high-level.  Temperament does not capture all of the subtelties and nuances within the character's psyche, instead capturing the character's general tone or outlook.
