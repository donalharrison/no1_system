# Character Creation

## Thesis
***Defining Your Character Concept***

As with all things creative or scientific, you have to have a starting point. The **Thesis** is the foundational statement of your character concept. It is a brief, 1-2 sentence summary that captures the core idea behind your character, including their tone, personality, and overarching theme. This statement serves as a guiding principle for developing your character’s background, motivations, and actions throughout the game.

#### How to Create a Thesis

When crafting your Thesis, consider the following:

1. **Core Idea:** What is the main concept or essence of your character? This could include their role, profession, or defining trait.
2. **Tone:** What is the overall mood or feel of your character? Are they heroic, tragic, mysterious, or comedic?
3. **Personality:** What are the key aspects of your character’s personality? This helps set the stage for how they will interact with others and approach challenges.
4. **Motivation:** What drives your character? Consider their goals, ambitions, or the events that have shaped their path.

#### Examples of Theses

- **"A stoic warrior seeking redemption for past mistakes, driven by a code of honor and duty."**
- **"A curious scholar eager to uncover ancient secrets, guided by a thirst for knowledge and adventure."**
- **"A cunning thief with a heart of gold, balancing a life of crime with a desire to protect the innocent."**
- **"A cheerful bard who brings joy to others, hiding their own past tragedies behind a mask of humor."**

#### Importance of the Thesis

The Thesis sets the tone for your character’s development and provides a clear direction for your roleplaying. It helps you stay true to your character’s core concept and ensures consistency in their actions and decisions. By starting with a strong Thesis, you create a solid foundation for a rich and engaging character that will enhance your overall gaming experience.

Use your Thesis as a touchstone throughout the game, allowing it to guide your character’s evolution and interactions. This initial statement will help you stay focused on your character’s essence and make your roleplaying more cohesive and immersive.

## THEME

The character theme expands on the Thesis, providing details, fleshing out personality and motivation, and giving the players more cues to to inform their roelplaying.  The No 1's System breaks character themes into 5 components -- **Temperament**, **Heritage**, **Esteem**, **Motivation**, and **Experience**.  Each of these components are one piece of the larger picture and can be referenced when the player needs inspiration for how the character would interacts with the game fiction.

### Temperament
The character's personality at a high-level.  Temperament does not capture all of the subtelties and nuances within the character's psyche, instead capturing the character's general tone or outlook.

#### Ruthless
You hold fast to one basic rule: get the job done. You've been called cold, calculating, and brutal. Your reputation for ruthless efficiency makes your fellows wary of you. But when failure is not an option, leaders go to you first.

#### Haunted
You are haunted by a past mistake that led to the suffering or death of innocents. This ghost from your past drives you to seek redemption, striving to right the wrongs and protect the innocent at all costs, even if it means putting yourself in harm's way.

#### Loyalist
You have unwavering loyalty to a cause, leader, or organization. This loyalty has defined your actions and decisions, sometimes putting you at odds with others who don't share your dedication. You will go to great lengths to support and defend your chosen allegiance.

#### Vengeful
Someone or something wronged you deeply in the past, and now your life is driven by a desire for vengeance. This burning need for retribution influences your every decision, often leading you down dark and dangerous paths. You will not rest until justice, or your version of it, is served.

#### Idealist
You hold an unwavering belief in a set of ideals or a vision for a better world. This idealism drives you to make sacrifices and take risks to bring about positive change. While some see you as a beacon of hope, others might view you as naive or impractical.

#### Cynic
Having seen the darker side of life, you no longer believe in the inherent goodness of people or institutions. Your cynicism makes you skeptical of others' motives and cautious in your actions. You rely on your sharp wit and keen perception to navigate through deceit and corruption.

#### Protector
You have a strong instinct to protect those who are weaker or in need. This protective nature often puts you in harm's way, as you are willing to sacrifice your own safety for the well-being of others. You are seen as a guardian and a champion by those you help.

#### Visionary
You have a unique and far-reaching vision that sets you apart from others. This vision drives you to pursue goals that others might find impossible or impractical. Your innovative thinking and determination can lead to great achievements, but also to isolation and misunderstanding.

#### Zealot
You are fiercely devoted to a particular cause, religion, or ideology. This zealotry drives your actions and decisions, often leading you to extremes that others might shy away from. Your passion can inspire and rally others, but it can also make you inflexible and intolerant of differing views.

You are constantly looking over your shoulder, ready to confront your past if necessary.

#### Nomad
You have spent most of your life wandering from place to place, never settling down for long. This nomadic lifestyle has made you adaptable and resourceful, but also rootless and longing for stability. You value freedom and new experiences above all else.

#### Mentor
You have a wealth of knowledge and experience, and you feel a strong duty to pass it on to others. This mentor role shapes your interactions, as you seek to guide and teach those around you. You are patient and wise, but can sometimes come across as overbearing or controlling.

#### Paragon

Characters were not born into a life of protagonism yesterday.  What roads have they wandered?  What spoils have they pilfered?  Who do they want to kill or, maybe more interestingly, who wants to kill them?  The No1s system's background procedure helps to prompt you to consider and answer questions like these and others to help fill in the detail of your character.
The background process also closely models the priamry gameplay procedure, allowing for even the newest players to familiarize themselves with the different types of dice, earning Hits, re-rolling 1s, etc.
