# Character Creation

## Formulate your Concept
As with all things creative or scientific, you have to have a starting point.  What story do you want to forge?

## Choose (or Roll) Trait Array
Characters in the No1 System have 5 Traits -- **Dangerous, Deft, Savvy, Steady, and Uncanny** -- which describe the characters' general qualities and characteristics, and categorize their Skills.  You will assign values to each of these to help construct your character's capabilities.

### Choose Your Primary Defense

## Choose Species

## Choose Lineage
For now, discuss lineage ideas with BAMF to determine Trai and/or skill bonuses

## Roll your background
Characters were not born into a life of protagonism yesterday.  What roads have they wandered?  What spoils have they pilfered?  Who do they want to kill or, maybe more interestingly, who wants to kill them?  The No1s system's background procedure helps to prompt you to consider and answer questions like these and others to help fill in the detail of your character.
The background process also closely models the priamry gameplay procedure, allowing for even the newest players to familiarize themselves with the different types of dice, earning Hits, re-rolling 1s, etc.

## Spend Milestones on Training
Invest your starting Milestone(s) and any gained from your background on Training Ranks, granting you Talents to deploy in your pursuits.
