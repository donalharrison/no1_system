Work in progress.  Needs to be termed, fleshed out, and refined.

# Waypoints

Waypoints are segments of game fiction.  They range in duration from a few short Scenes to entire adventures, bookended by and inciting incident and a resolution.

### Setting the Objective(s) & the Status-quo

### The Inciting Incident

After the inciting incident, players determine their *Focused Traits* and set off to achieve the Waypoint’s objectives.

### The Resolution

After a Waypoint’s resolution, all surviving characters restore their Defenses and Vitality, Schemes and Plots advance, and the players (including the BAMF) decide on the objective(s) of the next Waypoint.
