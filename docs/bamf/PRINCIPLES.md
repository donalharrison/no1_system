Work in progress.  These need to be pruned and refined.

# PRINCIPLES

1. Keep character abilities simple — exhaustive lists of highly-specified options impair player creativity and decision making
2. BAMFs need tools and resources — prep should be easy to start, simple to do, and self-propagating
3. BAMFs are in control — they are an arbiter of rules, they control the flow of the fiction
4. Good fiction requires drama, drama requires action
5. Good fiction is self-informing
6. The best games run like engines — each piece works together to produce the desired output
