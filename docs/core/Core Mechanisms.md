# Core Mechanisms

## Challenge
Challenge is the complexity and danger of a Scene, escalating as the stakes of the game increase.  Mechanically, Challenge defines the number of dice the player rolls when attempting any action (i.e., Challenge 1 = roll 1d, Challenge 8 = roll 8d).  For each die equal to or greate than the Target, 

## Core Roll Mechanic

Roll a number of dice equal Challenge (plus any applicable modifiers). Count 1 Hit for each die equal to or greater than the Target (e.g., 4+).

If there is a 1 in the result set, you risk allowing the enemy to seize the Initiative.

- If you have any unspent ranks in your focused Trait, you may choose to reroll any 1 in the result set.
- If the rerolled result set contains no 1s, total your Hits and your team maintains the Initiative.  Increase the Momentum.
- If the final result still contains any 1s, total your Hits and the enemy seizes the Initiative.  Increase the Entropy.

### Challenge: Result Sets, Hits, & 1s
Explain how Hits, 1s, entropy, & momentum change with challenge.

## Entropy
Entropy is a measure of how frantic and chaotic the fiction is becoming.  Low Entropy represents a fictional arc where things are going the characters' way, while high Entropy reflects an arc where things are out of the characters' control.
Entropy increases each time a 1 is contained in a roll's final results set.

## Momentum
Momentum measures the level of success and proactivity the characters have attained.  High Momentum reflects arcs where the characters are experience consistent success in their pursuits.
Momentum increases each time a roll's final result set contains no 1s and the players maintain the initiative.
