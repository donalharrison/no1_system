# Shifts

Shifts represent quick actions or movements that take minimal concentration or effort.  Some Shifts require players to make rolls.  The results of Shift rolls **do not risk shifting the Initiative to the enemy.**

## Move
- **Move to an adjacent zone**
- **Move within your current zone**
    - Move into proximity of a Point of Interest within your current Zone

## Use your equipment
- **Reload / Restring / Unjam a weapon**
- **Draw / Change  a weapon**

## Defy danger
- **Hide** - Roll Stealth to gain Hidden status
- **

## Create an advantage
- Describe a way to use a Skill quickly to aid in your allies efforts.
- Roll up to Challenge to create a number of Advantages in the Current Zone equal to the total Hits in the result set.
- Creating advantages does not count 1s against initiative, but does increase Entropy.
- Any ally can use an Advantages to:
    - **Bonus hits**: Add +1d4 Bonus Hits to any roll.
    - **Re-roll a 1**: Re-roll a single die in a result set that landed on 1.
    - **Trigger a talent**: Automatically use a Trigger Talent.
    - **Calm the chaos**: Reduce the current Entropy by 1.

## Wait For it. . .
Characters can prepare to attempt an Action until a certain condition is met, such as when an enemy enters their current Zone or an ally sounds lights the wagon on fire.  The player declares the Action and associated condition, then waits to make the roll to attempt the Action.
