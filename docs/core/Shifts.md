    - Move into proximity of a Point of Interest within your current Zone
## Use your equipment
- **Reload / Restring / Unjam a weapon**
- **Draw / Change  a weapon**
## Defy danger

## Create an advantage
- Roll up to Challenge to create a number of Advantages in the Current Zone equal to the total Hits in the result set.
- Creating advantages does not count 1s against initiative, but does increase Entropy.
- Any ally can use an Advantages to:
    - Bonus hits
    -
## Wait For it. . .
Characters can prepare to attempt an Action until a certain condition is met.  The player declares the Action and associated condition, then waits to make the roll to attempt the Action.
