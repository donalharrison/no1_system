# Shifts

Shifts represent quick actions or movements that take minimal concentration or effort.  Some Shifts require players to make rolls.  The results of Shift rolls **do not risk losing the Initiative to the enemy, but do increase the Entropy.**

## Move
- **Move to an adjacent zone**
- **Move within your current zone**
    - Move into proximity of or away from a Point of Interest within your current Zone

#### Moving & Hazards
*When a character moves out of a Zone or away from a Point of Interest that contains one or more Hazards, the player must roll a number of Hazard dice equal to the total Hazards present.*

## Use your equipment
- **Reload / Restring / Unjam a weapon**
- **Draw / Change  a weapon**
- **Use a consumable item**

## Defy danger
If an Action or Shift would cause you to add 1 or more Hazard dice to your roll, you may use this Shift to attempt to avoid the danger.  Choose on of the approaches below and roll against Challenge using the respective Skill and reduce the total number of Hazard dice equal to the Hits in the Result Set. 
- **Hide!** - Roll Stealth and gain Hidden status equal to your Hits.
- **Parkour!** - Roll Tumble to move through dangerous environment.
- **Prove your mettle!** - Roll Exert to power through painful or obstructive effects.

## Create an Advantage
- Describe a way to use a Skill quickly to aid in your allies efforts.
- Roll up to Challenge to create a number of Advantages in the Current Zone equal to the total Hits in the result set.

## Use an Advantage
- Any ally can use an Advantage to:
    - **Bonus Hits**: Add +1d4 Bonus Hits to any roll.
    - **Ignore a Hazard**: Remove 1 Hazard die from your next roll.
    - **Calm the chaos**: Reduce the current Entropy by 1.

## Initiate a Contest
You issue a challenge to a single enemy to engage you one on one.  If they take up your Challenge, you enter into a <a href='/no1_system/core/gameplay/contests/'>Contest</a>.

## Wait For it. . .
Characters can prepare to attempt an Action until a certain condition is met, such as when an enemy enters their current Zone or an ally lights the wagon on fire.  The player declares the Action and associated condition, then waits to make the roll to attempt the Action.
