# Zones

Zones are abstract areas for interaction.  A battlefield may be broken into a frontline field, a hilltop vantage, trenches, etc.  A city may consist of districts like markets, residential areas, palatial estates, etc.

## Points of Interest
Zones often contain specific features that can be interacted with or taken advantage of called Points of Interest.  Engaging with one of these features usually requires  characters to Shift within their Current Zone, then use an action to interact with the Point of Interest in some way.

## Zones, Movement, & Range

Moving to an Adjacent Zone requires the character to use a Shift.
Moving to an Adjacent Zone from your Current Zone in hostile encounters often draws threat from the enemy.  Characters who wish to avoid this danger can first use a Shift to Defy Danger, then Shift normally without drawing the enemy's ire.

### Current Zone
- Generally, melee attacks and personal interactions occur within your Current Zone
- Attacks made in Ranged combat, including thrown weapons, work in your Current Zone.


## Adjacent Zones
- Attacks made in ranged combat (e.g., Shoot, certain Magic attacks) work in Adjacent Zones.  Some ranged effects may have ranges beyond Adjacent Zones, but the effect will specify when this is the case.

## Example Zones

### Simple Zones
The forest clearing in front of a cavern entrance has 4 Zones -- the South, East, and West clearing, and the Cave Mouth.

### Simple Zones with Points of Interest
The steps of the Pharaoh's tomb is devided into the footsteps, the first and second landing, and the entryway.
There are 6 points of interest -- the arcane device flanked by two obelisks on the first landing, two arcophagi on the second landing, and the Tomb Doors at the entryway.

### Complex Zones with Elevation
Deep in the Sabljarn Caverns lies a crevasse of molten rock where the Ashenspire Clan funnels intruders to a fiery death.  
- The surrounding cliffs have three Zones (blue) that are elevated above the caver floor.
- The path down is treacherous through rughly hewn rock ridges (yellow), with the two southmost ridges connected by a rickety rope bridge.
- The cavern floor (orange) reaches the southern edge of the cavern to the north edge where the pass is blockaded by an Ashenspire outpost (red).
- The lava chasm (Point of Interest) rests in the midst of the cavern floor.
- The Ashenspire troops rest within a guardhouse (Point of Interest) behind their wall.
