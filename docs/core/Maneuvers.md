# Maneuvers
Maneuvers are special Actions that all player characters can attempt to impact the game fiction by interacting with the Momentum and Entropy.

## Using Maneuvers
Each Maneuver has a *Momentum Cost* and a condition.  On any of your turns when the Maneuver's condition is met, you can use an action to spend the required Momentum and roll 1d20 to attempt the Maneuver.  Maneuver effects differ widely and some have downsides if the attempt is unsuccessful -- choose wisely!
