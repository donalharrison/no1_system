# Statuses

## Afraid
If you are in the same Zone as the source of your fear, you must Shift out of your current Zone before you can take any Action.  If you are not in the same Zone as the source of your fear, you can take any Action that is not hostile toward the source of your fear.  The Afraid condition persists until you Recover using Composure.

## Blind
While Blind, add Hazard 4 to your rolls.

## Confused
While Confused, add 2 Hazard to your rolls.

## Dazed
Until the end of your next turn, you can either take one action or one shift, but not both.

## Dying
When your Grit is 0, roll 1d4 to determine your Dying rating.  Each turn while your Grit is 0, reduce your Dying rating by 1.  When your Dying rating is 5 or greater, you are Dead.

Any action that scores Hits against you gain a number of d4 Bonus Hits equal to your Vulnerable Rating.
