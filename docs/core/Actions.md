# Actions

Actions are more concerted efforts and advanced maneuvers that allow the player to effect the scene in dramatic ways.

To take actions, players describe what their character does and declare any associated targets.  If a roll is required, the BAMF will call for the player to roll a number of dice equal to the current Challenge (plus any applicable modifiers).

The player totals the number of Hits they achieved by counting the number of dice equal to or greater than the Target, typically 4. 

If the result set of an Action contains a 1, the initiative shifts to the opposing team.

The action may result in a Trigger for the player, which happens immediately following the resolution of the action.
