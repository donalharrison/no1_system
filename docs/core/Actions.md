# Actions

Actions are more concerted efforts and advanced maneuvers that allow the player to effect the scene in dramatic ways.  To take actions, players describe what their character does and declare any associated targets.  If a roll is required, the BAMF will call for the player to roll a number of dice equal to the current Challenge (plus any applicable modifiers).

The player totals the number of Hits they achieved by counting the number of dice equal to or greater than the Target, typically 4. If the result set of an Action contains a 1, the initiative shifts to the opposing team.

The action may result in a Trigger for the player, which happens immediately following the resolution of the action.

<h2>Use your Skills</h2>
<p>
This is the core Action of the No1 system.  A character attempts an action that requires them to draw on on of their Skills.  If the outcome of the action is uncertain or the characters are under pressure, the player rolls a number and type of dice equal to the current Challenge and the character rating in the attempted Skill, respectively.

<h2>Recover</h2>
<p>
Characters can use an action to Recover lost defenses.  To do so, the player declares which Defense they are attempting to recover which determines the Skill to be used in the roll:
<ul>
<li>Reflexes: Focus</li>
<li>Nerve: Composure</li>
<li>Vigor: Endure</li>
</ul>
The player rolls the a number of the appropriate Skill dice equal to Challenge, increasing the associated Defense by Hits +1.
