# System Principles
The No1s System is . . .
* The game fiction is dramatic; Drama = Tension + Resolution
* Cinematics are superior simulation
* The camera is always rolling, you're always in rounds


# Game Fiction Structural Overview
Gameplay in the No1s System is broken into segments of game fiction called *Waypoints*.  Analgous to a book chapter or play act, Waypoints range in duration from a few short interactions to entire adventures, and are bookended by an inciting incident and a resolution.  
Each Waypoint consists of one or more Scenes, each of which are comprised of one or more Encounters during which the Characters interact with the fiction.  Each level of the game's fictional structure (i.e., Waypoints, Scenes, Encounters) serves to move the game fiction forward, often raising the stakes of the game and propelling the characters toward the dramatic conclusion.
Waypoints are defined collaboratively, with the BAMF taking the lead on coordinating and planning.  Players are encouraged elect certain goals, missions, and lead to pursue while planning a Waypoint, and the BAMF populates the plots, situations, and details contained within.
Defining Waypoints (along with Scenes & Encounters) are discussed in greater detail in the BAMF section.
