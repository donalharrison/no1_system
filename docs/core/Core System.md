# System Principles
The No1s System is . . .
* The game fiction is dramatic; Drama = Tension + Resolution
* Cinematics are superior simulation
* The camera is always rolling, you're always in rounds


# Game Fiction Structural Overview
The No1 System is foundationally about discovering and progressing the story of heroes (or at the very least protagonists) undertaking perilous journey, facing impossible odds, and trying to unravel their enemies' plot(s).  This story is referred to as the *game fiction* and is structured heirarchically into subsections called *Waypoints, Scenes, and Encounters*.  Each level of the game's fictional structure (i.e., Waypoints, Scenes, Encounters) serves to move the game fiction forward, often raising the stakes of the game and propelling the characters toward a dramatic conclusion.

    <h2 style="margin-bottom:8px;">Waypoints</h2>

    <p>Stories in the No1s System are broken into segments of game fiction called <em>Waypoints</em>.  Analgous to a book chapter or play act, Waypoints range in duration from a few short interactions to entire adventures, and are bookended by an inciting incident and a resolution.
    <br>Waypoints are defined collaboratively, with the BAMF taking the lead on coordinating and planning.  Players are encouraged decide what goals, missions, and leads to pursue while planning a Waypoint, and the BAMF populates the plots, situations, and details contained within.  In this way, the game fiction develops transparently among the players

    <h2 style="margin-bottom:8px;">Scenes</h2>
    <img src="/no1_system/assets/img/scene.png" alt="One Scene marker" width="175" height="175">
    <p>Each Waypoint consists of one or more *Scenes*, which are detail the setting and characters involved in the particular section of the Waypoint.  Much like Waypoints, Scenes may vary in scope and duration depending on the Waypoint's objectives and the current context of the game fiction.

        <h2 style="margin-bottom:8px;">Encounters</h2>
        <p><img src="/no1_system/assets/img/action_skills.png" alt="Encounter action" width="175" height="175">
        Each Scene consists of one or more *Encounters* during which the Characters interact with the fiction.  Every encounter includes a Time and an Intitive which determine the duraution (in number of rounds) the Encounter will last and the *team* that takes the first action, respectively.</p>
        <h3 style="margin-bottom:6px;">Encounter Lenses</h3>
        <img src="/no1_system/assets/img/lens.png" alt="Encounter action" width="100" height="100">
        <p>Encounters differ in scope in terms of their *Lens* -- or the breadth of perspective that the audience or reader would have form outside the game fiction.  When the Encounter's Timer expires, the next Encounter begin immediately.  This could mean the Heroes have emerged victorious and the Encounter shifts to looting for treasure, or it could mean that enemy reinforcements arrive.  What is certain is that each Encounter has a discrete number of rounds to play out, allowing the players and BAMF to better strategize and apply the resources given the alloted time.
        </p>
        <p>The Lens of an encounter depends on the context of the current Scene and the larger game fiction.  As the heroes plunge into the melee once the enemy has broken through the gates, the Encounter has an *Action!* Lens, wherein every small detail and choice unfolds frantically in the heat of battle.  The week before the enemy's army arrives at the city, however, has a *Montage!* Lens, during which the characters take actions to prepare their defenses.  Once the city is safe again and the heroes revel in victory, the Encounter changes to a *Repose!* Lens while the characters rest and recover, gather information about the game fiction, spend the wealth, etc.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>No matter the Lens, the Encounter has a Time and Initiative to inform how long the players can expect the scenario to continue in its current state.  This toolset provide transparency to the players to optimize their actions across every Encounter to best prepare for subsequent Encoutners, Scenes, and accomplish greatness in every Waypoint of the game fiction.
