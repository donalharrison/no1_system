# Contests

Contests are sub-encounters that take place between two characters, usuall a PC and an NPC.  They are encapsulated within the scene during which they are initiated and can impact the encounter flow and outcomes of the scene and its encounters.

## Intiating Contests
Challengers can use a Shift on their turns to Intiate a Contest, issuing a challenge to a single target opposing them.  The challenger makes clear what they intend the contest to be -- a battle of wits, a clash of steel, or an arcane duel.  In doing so, the Challenger selects which Trait to be used in the Contest.  All rolls in the contest must use Skills associated with this Trait.

### Declining Contests
If the target declines a Contest, the challenger's team gains an immediate advantage:
* If the challenger is a PC, the Momentum increases by +2.
* If the challenger is an NPC, the Entropy increases by +2 and the PC loses 1 Renown (minimum 0).

### Accepting Contests
If the challenge is accepted, the contestants both roll 1d4 and sum the results to determine Contest Timer, which is the maximum number of rounds the Contest will take.

## Playing Contests
Once a challenge is accepted and the Contest's duration is determined, the contestants will make a single opposed roll against each other once per round until the Contest concludes.
The contestant that scores the most hits in the opposed roll wins the round.
Once a contestant uses a Skill during a Contest, that contestant suffers a -1 Hit penalty for each subsequent use of that Skill until the Contest concludes.
Players are encouraged to describe interesting descriptions for how their character is usign a skill.  The BAMF may disallow a specific Skill depending on the current context in the game fiction.

## Concluding Contests
Contests can conclude in one of four ways:
1. The Game Fiction changes such that the Contest is no longer coherent or relevant.
2. The Contest Timer expires.
3. One of the contestants forfeits, declaring their opponent the Victor of the Contest.
4. One of the contestants is defeated.


Once the Contest concludes, the victor is the contestant who won the most rounds.
* If the victor is a PC, the PC gains +1 Renown and the Momentum increases by +5.
* If the victor is an NPC, the Entropy increases by +5 and the BAMF advances 1 Situation.

If the result is a draw, the contestants' hatred grows and they look forward to a rematch.
